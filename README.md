## About This Repository
This repository contains our submission for Assignment 3 of CSI4142 - Fundamentals of Data Science. The focus of this assignment is **Predictive Analysis**, specifically:
- Regression analysis using linear regression techniques
- Classification analysis using various classification algorithms

The assignment is implemented entirely in **Python** and documented using **Jupyter Notebooks** to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and clarity in our analysis.

## Repository Structure
This repository consists of three branches:
1. **Main**: Contains only this README file.
2. **dataset-1**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for the regression analysis on the Medical Insurance Costs dataset.
3. **dataset-2**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for the classification analysis on the Diabetes dataset. 

Each dataset and its respective processing are thoroughly explained within their respective Jupyter Notebooks.
